            The production of a Podcast is another cool feature of jPodder allowing you
            to be your own <b><i>Radio Station</i></b>.

        <p>
            The main view of the production is depicted below. It consists of a
            a general section and an 'items' section. You can think of an item
	    as a single entry for your podcast. The item contains information 
	    like a description, a publication date but also, as you will learn
	    in this chapter, the enclosure information. The enclosure information
	    contains the URL or link to your podcast.
