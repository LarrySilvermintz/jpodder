            <i id="element">Mime Type</i> - defines the type of a document or attachement
            so that the application can use the appropriate application to handle it.
            <i id="element">MIME</i> stands for Mulitpurpose Internet Mail Extension
            and normally uses this pattern: &lt;document type&gt;/&lt;sub type&gt;.
            In an application the Mime type is not associated with one or more applications
            the application can use to present it to the user. As the name suggests this
            was originally created for <i id="element">emails</i> but is not widely used
            in the web.
