<h2>jPodder 1.1</h2>
<p>More bug fixing.</p>

<h2>jPodder 1.1RC2</h2>
<p>Fixed various problems:
	- Content Range handling. (Libsyn doesn't support partial downloads anymore). 
	- You can move your podcast folder. We will adapt the feed file location.
	- Upgrade helper. 
	- More finetuning.
</p>


<h2>jPodder 1.1RC1</h2>

<p>It took 5 months to deliver this baby! We switch UI to SWT. Why?
Modern apps need a lot of integration with web (Clickable links, build HTML
rendering etc<span class=GramE>..)</span> No way <span class=GramE>it could</span>
be done with Swing so we added SWT. The UI is now also like a native
application on your OS. (Run on windows only for now). </p>

<p>Any new features? Well not really. There
are actually less features. Production was removed, and som ID3 rewrite
function is limited. (Not per feed basis). It’s <span class=GramE>OK,</span>
still all you need is there. There a couple of other nice surprise, but I’ll
you discover it. But beware, jPodder is a very powerfull downloader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enjoy Christophe</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> 0.8</h2>

<p>This version of jPodder is improving the<span class=GramE>&nbsp; usability</span>
with instant status feedback, Podcast life-cycle management,&nbsp; download
improvements and easy migration from other iPodder clients. A detailed
description of the features is provided below.</p>

<p><u>Overview status bar</u></p>

<p>In personal feeds, The overview status bar provides instant feedback on how
many feeds are subscribed to, the total number of marked enclosures, the next
scheduled download time, the number of files in a feed (When selected), the
total number of bytes consumed by a feed, the currently selected player.</p>

<p><u>Action bar</u></p>

<p>Located at the top of the personal feeds tab, the action bar reports the
most relevant actions. This gives you instead feedback on what is currently
happening and which task is reporting a finished job. (Many tasks operate
simultaneously in jPodder).</p>

<p><u>Podcast Life-Cycle &amp; &quot;Ghost feeds&quot;</u></p>

<p>The enclosure/preview panel, is now also a file panel, you can now see both
the enclosures and the previously downloaded files for the feed. <span
class=GramE>If a file is both an enclosure and visible on the folder, it is
displayed as an enclosure.</span> (Highlighting is blue). If a file is not an
enclosure it's highlighted in orange. You can choose to remove the files (Both
from disc and player) or add them to the player if missing. The marking column
is now context sensitive, for files on <span class=GramE>disc,</span> marking
allows deletion of the files. (Files on the disc are auto-marked). Files can
also be deleted individually or by selecting multiple rows. <b>How? </b>Files
in the folder are displayed automatically.&nbsp;</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>To deleted marked files
     select a feed, Mark the enclosures and files, right-click on the
     feed-table-&gt; delete marked.&nbsp;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>To delete a single or
     multiple file (regardless of marking) right-click on the file-table -&gt;
     delete selected...</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>To add a missing file to the
     player right-click on the feed-table -&gt; update player...&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> will also scan the root folder for folders
corresponding to feeds, which are not in the personal feed list. The
&quot;ghost feeds&quot; can be deleted or added to the player. As the URL of
the feed is &quot;unknow&quot; it can<span class=GramE>&nbsp; be</span>
&quot;looked-up&quot; in the directory. (The ghost feed folder name, is used as
a query in the directory).</p>

<p><u>Single download &amp; downloads resume</u></p>

<p>Download has been extended with support for single-file download.&nbsp; This
provides easier access to the downloading, not needing to initiate a subscribed
feed download.&nbsp;<span class=GramE>(Pressing Download Now!)</span> <b>How? </b>When
right-clicking on an enclosure, a popup menu will show and<span class=GramE>&nbsp;
you</span> can select to download the enclosure.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Partially downloaded files are automatically resumed. The continuation of
the download is <span class=GramE>transparent,</span> no special action is
required from the user.</p>

<p><u>Direct Play</u></p>

<p>You can play a file directly in the selected player. Simply right click on
the enclosure and select &quot;play&quot;. This is only supported for already
downloaded files. (On disc column is flagged).&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>URL Decoding</u></p>

<p>Feed URL's are now properly decoded using the URL decoding standard RFC This
gets rid of odd looking encoding strings in titles and file names.</p>

<p><u>Cache learning</u></p>

<p>You can now instruct jPodder to update the cache with files which are in the
folder but might be missing from the cache. (In case the cache.xml file got
lost or damaged). You can tell jPodder which cache file to use. <b>How? </b>Settings-&gt;Download,
check mark the option to &quot;update cache entries&quot;.</p>

<p><u>Import</u></p>

<p><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> can import the settings and feeds file from
other iPodder-Lemon in case you want to start using&nbsp; jPodder and have used
iPodder-lemon before. <b>How</b>? In Settings-&gt;<span class=GramE>Import ,</span>
Just point to the iPodder folder and click import, you will see an overview
first.</p>

<p><u>BitTorrent</u></p>

<p>Share ratio and total downloaded bytes is now visible in the download panel.</p>

<p><u>MP3</u></p>

<p>The latest version of the MP3 library (<span class=GramE>vd</span> Heide) is
now included resulting in better MP3 support.</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> 0.7.3 maintenance release:</h2>

<p>Bug fixes:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Copying to player (iTunes) fixed.</p>

<p>- Enclosure marking should behave correctly (Tested very limited).&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> 0.7.2 maintenance release:</h2>

<p>Bug fixes:</p>

<p>- Double player (iTunes) entries when selecting &quot;Copy media to iTunes
folder&quot; option selected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Empty categories from iPodderX filtered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Marking of all enclosure after a scheduled refresh/download is changed to

<p>- Added option to select &quot;no player&quot;. Downloaded files will not be
transferred.</p>

<p>- Non-Win32 release which excludes all win32 related code. (COM interface to

<h2><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> 0.7.1 maintenance release:</h2>

<p>Some bugfixes:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Enclosure marking is now remembered when:&nbsp; 1) opening/closing jPodder
2) Browsing through the feed list 3) previewing/refreshing. The marking is only
overriden when scheduling kicks in. For manual downloads the marking is
preserved.</p>

<p>- Fixed enclosure highlighting problem (purple highlighting)<span
class=GramE>,.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Add Mark-all / Un-Mark all enclosures action. <span class=GramE>(Righ-click

<h2><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> 0.7 release:</h2>

<p>Welcome to the 0.7 release of jPodder. This release optimizes some existing
features, aswell as introduces new advanced stuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Optimized enclosure previewing:</u></p>

<p>The RSS feed is not parsed automatically when selecting a feed in the feed
table. The user has to press the preview/refresh button to parse the RSS file
and view the enclosures inside. The file is only parsed if the last-modified
date as returned by the server is not changed. The enclosures inside the RSS feed
are only queried if jPodder hasn't done some previously. The state of the RSS
feed and enclosures are &quot;remembered&quot; by jPodder even when restarting
the application.</p>

<p>These changes have major impact on response times and the overall number of
network queries like HTTP HEAD.&nbsp; It benefits the user to a great
extend.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>GUI Enhancements:</u></p>

<p>Various parts of the GUI have been enhanced:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Directory: 1) New icons, 2) Trimming of feed title in add button. 3)
Subscribed feed has need icon</p>

<p>- Personal Feeds: 1) <span class=GramE>It's</span> now possible to move
feeds up and down the list with new buttons to the left of the feed
table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>- <span class=GramE>Settings :</span> 1) The settings panel is now a tree
structure, which looks nicer and prepared for expansion when adding new
settings.</p>

<p>- <span class=GramE>Download :</span> 1) Download time is displayed. 2)
Corrected some wrong displaying of the progress bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Windows Media Player Support:</u></p>

<p><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> can now stored downloaded media files into
windows Media Player. The preferred player can be selected in the settings
panel -&gt; media. (Limitation)Please note the implementation can not detect if
a file already exists in WMP.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class=GramE><u>bitTorrent</u></span><u> support</u></p>

<p>Besides multiple concurrent downloads, jPodder now supports bitTorrent
downloads. After jPodder has downloaded a file ending on .torrent, it will
automatically be added to the bitTorrent download table. This table is the
lower pane in the download panel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bitTorrent will automatically seed after the download completed. Please
note the bitTorrent Azureus module create a subdirectory in the users home
directory to store configuration information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ID3v2 MP3 Viewing:&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class=GramE>Basic support of ID3v2 viewing.</span> <span class=GramE>jPodder</span>
can display ID3 information as supplied in the MP3 file.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>jPodder</span> 0.6 release:</h2>

<p>0.6, <span class=GramE>This</span> new release solves various bugs and
incorporates new features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- GUI Improvements:</p>

<p>Action buttons re-arranged for all the panels, Clear log button, Auto
scrolling of log. <span class=GramE>Highlighting of download selection.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Server based search function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A server based directory browse/search function has been implemented using
the iPodderX. Retrieved feeds can be added to personal feeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Download panel:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Downloads are now visualized in a download table, with progress and speed.
They can be queued and aborted at user pleasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Build-in User Guide</p>

<p>A new panel as been added, showing a user guide. The guide describes usage
of jPodder.</p>

<p>- HTTP Client Apache implementation.</p>

<p>Not directly visible to the user, but the java.net API is not used any more
for HTTP connections. <span class=GramE>jPodder</span> is now fully based on
the Apache Commons httpClient. This results in various improvements like
setting of the user-agent, better performance,<span class=GramE>&nbsp; HTTP</span>
time-out settings etc...It is the fundament for more HTTP features in jPodder.</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>iPodder</span> 0.5-beta release:</h2>

<p>I decided to release a beta version of 0.5. I didn't have a lot of time to
test it, so I appreciate your feedback in case of malfunction. The new features
are pretty neat, so enjoy it! <a href="mailto:christophe.bouhier@kualasoft.com">christophe@kualasoft.com</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>New features:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Multi tasking (previews, inspection, downloads).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Enclosure previews.</p>

<p>- RSS feed import from OPML (This is a basic function The OPML links are not
&quot;followed&quot; to absorb additional RSS feeds).&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Visualized downloads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's been 3 weeks since the release of the 0.2 version. I have done some
major rework of the code introducing multi-threading, which means various task
are executed independently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally one of the key new <span class=GramE>feature</span> is the
&quot;enclosure-preview&quot;. This feature displays the enclosures in a table
view including various information, like the cache status, the file size on the
disc and on the server etc....As downloads occur in the background, the preview
function gives a high level of interactivity, so that new feeds can be
checked.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class=GramE>OPML import.</span> You can import an OPML file, the file
will be scanned and the RSS feeds will be your new feeds in jPodder.</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>iPodder</span> 0.2 release:</h2>

<p>I stepped the release number by a decimal, I believe it's worth it with the
following new features/improvements:&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>System tray</u></p>

<p><span class=GramE>iPodder</span> can now be minimized in the system tray. <span
class=GramE>iPodder</span> can be brought forward by single-clicking the system
tray icon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>GUI</u></p>

<p>The <span class=GramE>gui</span> now contains Tab panels for Feeds, Log and
Settings. The GUI look &amp; feel is based on the JGoodies plastic L&amp;F.</p>

<p><u>Feed Selection</u></p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Feeds can be selected for
     download or skipped.&nbsp;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>If selected, the number of
     downloads can be set. (The default is 1).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>The feeds settings are now
     stored and retrieved in XML (feeds.xml).</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Scheduling</u></p>

<p>The scheduler is improved in many aspects.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>You can turn it on or off.
     This can be done in the system tray or in the settings panel.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>When stopping, this is a hard
     stop (It kills the scanning<span class=GramE>&nbsp; process</span>), this
     can result in partially saved files and unclosed objects. It is
     recommended, to limit the use of this feature as the effects are unknown.
     (Sun has deprecated this function in the Thread API).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Feed scanning</u></p>

<p>The scanning of feeds has been <span class=GramE>rebuild</span> from
scratch. <span class=GramE>iPodder</span> now performs tasks in the following
order (This can be witnessed in the logging pane).</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Collect enclosures from a
     feed.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Extract a folder name from
     the first feed title.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Mark the &quot;known&quot;
     enclosures from either the cache register or the download folders.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Download the unmarked
     enclosures (Limited by a maximum).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Store the new downloads in the
     cache file</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Store the newly downloaded
     enclosure in the player (iTunes is only supported for now).</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Settings</u></p>

<p>Settings have been greatly improved with support for:&nbsp;</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>Download folder
     selection&nbsp;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>HTTP Proxy Settings (Needs
     more settings.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>Scheduler settings</li>
</ol>

<p>Settings are stored in the feeds.xml file.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Caching</u></p>

<p>Caching is now also XML based, all resolved enclosures are cached for
further querying.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>iPodder</span> 0.1i release:</h2>

<p>- It seemed I was using izPack installer wrongly! <span class=GramE>this</span>
resulted in a large .zip file, as all files are already packaged by izPack in
the install.jar file. This is now solved and the file is back to normal size.
The next release will&nbsp;</p>

<p>- This release also contains a new build of the jawin library. It solves
some funny string output on the console. Also iPodder now has an icon
(Unbelievable how much time one can spend on a stupid icon).&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The GUI is now extended with a manual starter, so you can start/stop
podcasting. It also contains a scheduler which can use to set podcasting time
at intervals of 15 minutes.</p>

<p>- Connections through an HTTP proxy is supported (manually<span class=GramE>)
,</span> but for this you will have to add the following properties to the java
command:&nbsp;</p>

<p><span lang=FR style='mso-ansi-language:FR'>-Dhttp.proxyHost<span
class=GramE>=<b>[</b></span><b>Your proxy]&nbsp; </b>-Dhttp.proxyPort=<b>[Your
Port e.g. 80]</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Hope you enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>iPodder</span> 0.1h release:</h2>

<p>There was a bug in my deployment script,<span class=GramE>&nbsp; (</span> in
build.xml, As I use <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jakarta</st1:place></st1:City>
ant to compile, archive, copy, test, zip, create install and upload the
application), which freaked me out for a couple of days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This release includes an installer! The installation is there for somewhat
friendlier. I see this as a first step, I have also figured out how to create
executable and shortcuts, so it will become much better coming weeks. (Stay
tuned).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I started to <span class=GramE>migrate</span> XML parsing to a dedicated class,
and will try to use SAX instead of DOM, this will probably allow me to bundle a
smaller size library, which will reduce the overall file size. (I admit it's
big for such a tiny program).&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is still something funny <span class=GramE>happening</span> a String
is printed on standard output and I have no idea where it comes from. I checked
all error traps, but can not find when and where this occurs (anyone interested
in having a look in the code?)&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span class=GramE>iPodder</span> 0.1e release:</h2>

<p>Storing of tracks in iTunes is now <span class=GramE>supported,</span> also
the code will avoid duplications in iTunes playlists. Caching will write to
memory.txt, but as a check is made if the file is already on the disc, I doubt
what this function really adds?</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>

<p>This is a JAVA application, which supports the win32 version of iTunes. It
will not work on any other platform (yet). To run the <span class=GramE>application
simply make</span> sure that the Java Runtime Environment is installed. It's
easy to check when typing:</p>

<p><span class=GramE>java</span> -version</p>

<p>When installed, the command above will reply with the java version on your
system, otherwise install java from:</p>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a></p>

<p>To run the application, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Unzip the file to a directory of choosing. [<span class=GramE>dir</span>]</p>

<p>2) <span class=GramE>goto</span> the [dir]\bin directory and type <b>install.cmd</b>,
follow instruction and install iPodder on your system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) Open the [dir]\bin feeds.txt file using notepad or other text editor.
Change the first line to your directory of choosing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3) <span class=GramE>run</span> iPodder from the start-menu or goto the
[dir]\bin directory and type <b>iPodder.cmd</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4) This will start a small window, and access the feeds in your feeds.txt
file</p>
