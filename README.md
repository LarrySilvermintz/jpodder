# jpodder

Wauw... that's a trip to memory lane. I wrote JPodder after hearing aboutextracting mp3 files from RSS feeds at night and 
listening to them in the morning. (Adam Curry ignited this). 

I abannoned the project, when itunes started to support podcasting, and introduced there own file format, which many podcasters
started to adopt. So envisioning, Apple would take this further I decided to stop development. 

10 years or so later, JPodder is still being download from sourceforge! 
I ported it to github, it's harder to build now, as I need maven version 1, but perhaps I'll find sometime to make it run again 
with current maven version.
